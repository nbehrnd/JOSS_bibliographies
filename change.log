This is file change.log, providing a brief survey about modifications
in the project "Joss_biliographies".

YYYY-MM-DD | key events
-----------|---------------------------------------------------------
2019-07-08 | Initial deposit of the scripts bibtool_Joss_pocket.py
             and bibtool_Joss_bibtex.py on GitHub.  To collect a
             selection of bibliographic data of publications accepted
             by JOSS, the corresponding zip archive is extracted
             completely.  The relevant data are retrieved from .html
             as source files which eventually are removed, like all
             other intermediate data; yielding simple .txt, .csv or
             .bib for further processing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
2019-07-09 | While accessing the corresponding .zip archive, both 
             scripts now retrieve only the source files read-out,
             i.e. only the .html (bibtool_Joss_pocket.py), or only
             the *.crossfile.xml (bibtool_Joss_bibtex.py).
